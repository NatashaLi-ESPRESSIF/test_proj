## Introduction

For a good touchpad sensor design, it is necessary to monitor touchpad sensor readings, such as raw count value, baseline value and deviation of the count value, for calibration and debugging, and, most importantly, for **evaluating the touch system performance in terms of Sensitivity, SNR (Signal-to-noise ratio) and Channel Coupling**.

This document introduces a new tool for monitoring touchpad sensor readings: ESP-Tuning Tool. It is specially designed to debug and optimize touchpad sensor performance. Before reading this document, you might have known much about the technologies related to touchpad sensor. But if you want to read more about the technologies in this field, please refer to [Touchpad Sensor Application Note](https://github.com/espressif/esp-iot-solution/blob/master/documents/touch_pad_solution/touch_sensor_design_en.md).

## Overview

ESP32 supports the UART interface, which can help in monitoring touchpad sensor readings. With UART, the ESP32 data can be read and sent to a PC via USB. See Figure 1 below showing how ESP-Tuning Tool uses touchpad sensor readings from ESP32 via ESP-Prog (UART-to-USB bridge) to draw a diagram. 

The following items will be used in this document to further demonstrate how the above mentioned process works:

 - [ESP32-Sense-Kit dev board](https://github.com/espressif/esp-iot-solution/blob/master/documents/evaluation_boards/esp32_sense_kit_guide_en.md)
 - [ESP-Prog for firmware downloading](https://github.com/espressif/esp-iot-solution/blob/master/documents/evaluation_boards/ESP-Prog_guide_en.md)

## ESP-Tuning Tool Interface

### Homepage

Figure 2 shows the homepage of ESP-Tuning Tool, which consists of the following four sections:

1. Tab Bar
There are three tabs in total: Home, ESP-Tuning Tool, and Sensitivity/SNR Test.  

2. Communication Column
This section contains:

   - Communication related parameters: **Baud Rate**, **Port** 
   - Device information: **Device Type**, **Mac Address** 
   - **Get Port** button: updates port list
   - **Refresh** button: reconnects the device
    
3. ESP32 Pin Mapping  
It indicates the pads currently in use.  

4. Touchpad Control  
This section shows the touchpad in different combinations or shapes. Once you click a combination, you are directed to a page containing details related to the chosen combination, as shown in Figure 5 below.  

<div align="center"><img src="../_static/esp_tuning_tool/ESP_Tuning_tool_1.png" width = "800" alt="Homepage" align=center /></div>  
<div align="center">Figure 2. ESP-Tuning Tool Homepage</div>  

### Sensitivity/SNR Page

Figure 4 shows the Sensitivity/SNR page of ESP-Tuning Tool. On this page, you may test the sensitivity as well as SNR and channel coupling of the touch system, and improve the system performance accordingly to meet the specific requirements by saving the parameter settings to the [touch sensor file](https://github.com/espressif/esp-iot-solution/blob/master/examples/touch_pad_evb/main/evb.h). The Sensitivity/SNR page consists of the following five sections:

1. Tab Bar 
The same as above.  

2. Analysis Column
It lists the channel number, along with the SNR and Sensitivity data analyzed by ESP-Tuning Tool.  

3. Raw Data Bar Chart
It demonstrates the real-time pulse count value (raw data) of the currently used touchpad channels. As shown in this chart, you may use the non-touch value and touch value on each channel to calculate the change rate of touch readings with the following formula: **(non-touch value - touch value) / non-touch value * 100%**. This change rate can further be used to calculate the touch threshold. For a highly stable touch system, this rate should be greater than 3%.

4. Raw Data Line Chart

   It demonstrates the history raw data of the currently used touchpad channels. SNR and channel coupling are the important parameters to evaluate the touch system performance. You can calculate SNR (the signal-to-noise ratio) by using the value as shown in Figure 3 below:

   - **Sensor signal level**: the amount of touch reading change
   - **Idle channel noise level**: the noise level of a channel when it is idle

 **SNR = Sensor signal level / Idle channel noise level** (the SNR of a highly stable touch system should be greater than 5:1)

<div align="center">Figure 3. SNR Calculation</div>   
    
This line chart can also be used to evaluate the channel coupling, which in some cases may occur if two touch channel traces are adjacent and have no hatched ground. Specifically, when a touch event occurs, the pulse count value of the adjacent channel changes.

5. Touchpad Channel
 
It shows the touchpad channels that are currently in use. You may tick the right boxes to select the specific channels you want to check in the bar chart and the line chart. Please note that the color of each channel is consistent across this tuning tool.

<div align="center">Figure 4. ESP-Tuning Tool Sensitivity/SNR Test page</div>  

### Detailed Data Page

Figure 5 shows the detailed data page of ESP-Tuning Tool. On this page, you may check if the touch system is working properly by testing the baseline value, the amount of touch reading change, touch threshold, real-time pulse count value, etc. This page consists of the following four sections:

1. Button Bar
It contains five buttons for zoom-in, restore, start, pause, and preview respectively.
    - Zoom-in: enlarges the selected area
    - Restore: switches back to the previous status
    - Start: begins displaying real-time data
    - Pause: pauses displaying real-time data
    - Preview: you can place the mouse cursor over a point of interest in the line chart to preview the data of all the selected channels at the specific time as indicated by the horizontal axis.

2. Raw Data Line Chart
    - shows the raw data of the touchpad channels currently in use
    - contains the baseline value of all the channels currently in use
    - features scroll bars on the bottom and on the right for an extended view

3. The Line Chart Indicating Touchpad Status
If the touch electrodes are arranged in different combinations, such as matrix buttons, this chart indicates if a touch event has occurred by showing the following:
   - **0**: no touch event
   - **1**: touch event has occurred
   
When the touch electrodes appear as sliders, the chart traces and logs the last position of the sliders.

4. Touchpad Channels
It shows the touchpad channels that are currently in use. You may tick the right boxes to select the specific channels you want to check in the line chart. Please note that the color of each channel is consistent across this tuning tool.

Step 5: Modify the touchpad sensor parameters according to the touchpad sensor readings

 - If, after checking the SNR related chart, you notice that the touch sensor system fails to meet the ideal performance, you may modify the touchpad parameters to optimize the system performance.
 
 - Check the line chart and modify the touchpad parameters according to the touch value and non-touch value as given in this chart.
 
 - As shown in the figure below, click the preview button to check the touch value and non-touch value, and modify the change rate of touch readings on a specific touchpad channel according to the formula **(non-touch value - touch value) / non-touch value**.

Step 6: Evaluate the touch system performance

 - Evaluate the touchpad sensitivity according to the amount of the change in touchpad raw data and the touchpad status, as shown in the line chart drawn by ESP-Tuning Tool.

## FAQS

 - In case a port error occurs, please check if the current user has the permission to use this port (for Linux system, make sure the port permission is granted).
 
 - If the port cannot be found in the port list after a new device is plugged in, please click the **Get Port** button to refresh the port list.
  
 - In case of failing to detect the device information, please make sure the correct port is selected and click the **Refresh** button to request a second connection.
 
 - If the expected port does not appear in the port list, please make sure the device has been plugged in with the correct port number and baud rate selected. Then click the **Get Port** button to refresh the port list. At this point, the new device should appear in the list.
